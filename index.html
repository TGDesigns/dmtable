                <dd>Above table talk at a minimum please. Please try and keep all discussions in character if related to
                  story and actions (not if its a rule question). 'Critical Role play' as much as possible. This WILL
                  affect gameplay.
                  <br /><br />For example, if your talking about whether you're going to attack someone or kill them
                  after - you better whisper and roll stealth cause they may have heard you...<br /><br /><i>This is in
                    an effort to produce individual character decisions and character development rather than herd

                <dt>Long Rests</dt>
                <dd>Long Rests are going to be more difficult. You need to have ample conditions to take a long rest.
                  Otherwise, a short rest will be necessary. This means walls and lodging or guard shifts if in the
                  wilderness with somewhere where you can get 8 hours of sleep. I will be having a difficulty level for
                  where you choose to set up camp that you wont be aware of. The night brings interesting creatures.
                  Also, if you choose to have someone stand guard, they dont get the benefits of a rest. If you choose
                  to people to stand guard, they get the beneifts of a short rest only.<br /><br /><i>This is in an
                    effort to
                    bring awareness to surroundings and danger, make your headstrong pushes in to battle more critical,
                    as well as add more critical decision making and bring short rests and those classes/races with

                <dd>Travel is going to be more vital. Depending on how you are going to get somewhere we will not just
                  skip over weeks of travel. We may montage long travel periods but most travel will be in game ot an

              <h3>Notes - Setting Details</h3>
              <p>We are in the same setting as our previous campaign but roughly 100 years in the future. Your former
                characters were not much heard of as they dissapeared upon exploring wave echo cave and never returned
                with the exception of stories past down from a few adventurers long before this time. About 400 years
                ago, A Rudolph Van Richten and his protege, Ezmerelda, wrote a "guide to Ravenloft" which mentioned
                individuals matching your missing adventurers but have not been heard from again.</p>
              <p>In this beginning, I'm going to give a large intro to set the scene and get us started. It will give us
                a lot of details of fae'run and the lore within.</p>
              <p>I will then illustrate a setting for your characters. When I give you the floor, please describe your
                character followed by a little role play of what your character does or says before I continue on.</p>

            <div class="prologue">
              <h3>Prologue</h3>
              <p>The Sword Coast, a land of vast beauty and diverse cultures, stretches along the western shores of
                FaerÃ»n
                in the Forgotten Realms. Its cities and towns teem with life, bustling with adventurers seeking glory,
                riches, and the thrill of daring quests. Yet, beyond the surface, shadows stir, and the winds carry
                whispers of impending change.</p>
              <p>Amidst this coastline, the factions of the realm maneuver in the shadows, each with their own
                agenda. Many factions including, The Lords' Alliance, a coalition of influential cities and leaders,
                seeks to uphold order and
                rally the forces of good and justice. The Harpers, a clandestine organization with eyes and ears in
                every
                corner, strive to uncover secrets and protect the innocent. The Zhentarim, enigmatic and inscrutable,
                manipulate events for their own gain but in what they believe is good for the realms. And many others
                working deep in the shadows or for the good of fae'run.</p>
              <p>In the celestial realm, the gods watch over their domains. Temples and shrines
                dedicated to these deities stand as beacons of hope, offering solace to those seeking divine
                intervention.
                From the stalwart Helm, guardian of the innocent, to Tymora, lady luck herself, the gods'
                influence shapes the destinies of mortals.</p>
              <p>The Sword Coast, however, is not merely a realm of factions and divine influence. Mighty dragons,
                majestic and fearsome, soar through the skies, their presence a testament to their power. Ogres,
                Bugbears and goblins, lurk in murky corners. Dwarves, Elves, and elementals all make their presence
                known. Some creatures are
                benevolent, bestowing wisdom or aid upon those they deem worthy. Others, driven by greed and aggression,
                leave a trail of destruction in their wake. Legends speak of ancient artifacts, imbued with
                extraordinary power, hidden within treacherous dungeons or guarded by formidable foes.</p>
              <p>In present day on the sword coast, Rumors have begun to circulate, like ripples in a pond, speaking of
                mysterious rumblings in the depths of
                the wilds. Hushed voices speak of colossal beings, their presence felt in the tremors of the earth and
                the
                distant echoes of thunderous footsteps. But the nature and purpose of these massive figures remain
                shrouded in uncertainty.</p>
              <p>As these whispers spread, fear tinges the air, and the people of the Sword Coast find themselves on the
                edge of anticipation. The ground quivers with each passing day, leaving villages and settlements on
                alert,
                uncertain of what the future may hold.</p>
              <p>And so, as destiny weaves its tapestry, your paths converge. United by a common purpose, you find
                yourselves drawn into a journey that will lead you across the breadth of the Sword Coast. From the
                bustling streets of Waterdeep, the City of Splendors, to the ancient ruins of Neverwinter, and even to
                the
                untamed wilderness of the Savage Frontier, your adventure will take you to both familiar and unknown
                territories.</p>
              <p>With each step you take, you will encounter allies and adversaries, face trials and tribulations, and
                uncover the secrets that lie within the realm. The Sword Coast awaits, a canvas for your heroic exploits
                and a crucible for your character's growth. The fate of the realms rests in your hands, and the choices
                you make will shape the course of this world.</p>
              <p>Prepare yourselves, valiant adventurers, for an extraordinary odyssey through the Sword Coast. The
                stage
                is set, the curtain rises, and your epic quest begins.</p>
              <hr />
              <h3>Character Intros</h3>
              <h4>Yeldon and Celeste</h4>
              <p>As the sun dawns, casting a warm golden glow over the landscape, the High Road stretches south of
                Waterdeep, meandering through the northern reaches of the region. The road cuts a path through dense
                forests, where towering trees create a canopy overhead, dappling the path with patches of sunlight. A
                gentle breeze rustles through the leaves, carrying with it the earthy fragrance of moss and wildflowers.
              </p>
              <p>In the growing light, a camp is set up by the roadside, nestled amidst the towering trees. A crackling
                campfire sends flickering flames into the decreasing darkness, casting dancing shadows upon the gnarled
                tree trunks. The surrounding forest comes alive with the symphony of chirping birds and the occasional
                rustle of unseen creatures moving through the underbrush.</p>
              <p>A short stout man walks along the High Road, their eyes widen in surprise at the sight of the campsite
                and its lone inhabitant gathering their belongings. Standing tall and well-built, the figure exudes
                strength and resilience. Silver dreaded hair cascades down her back, contrasting with shaved sides,
                giving her a striking Viking-like appearance. Her honey-gold eyes hold a sense of determination and an
                unyielding spirit.</p>
              <p>Curiosity piqued, the man stops in their tracks, studying the camp from a distance. The small glasses
                perched upon their nose amplify their inquisitive gaze. Their elegant red hat adds a touch of whimsy to
                their gnomish appearance, as if the wild nature of the surroundings has inspired their own sense of
                adventure.</p>
              <p>The High Road becomes the crossroads where these two individuals' paths intersect, the gnome's journey
                momentarily halted by the presence of the solitary barbarian. It holds the promise of adventure,
                companionship, and the chance for these disparate souls to find their respective places in a world
                filled with mystery and possibilities.</p>
              <p>Tristan and Alec, the floor is yours...</p>
              <hr />
              <p>Will you both roll a perception check for me?</p>
              <p>+ 10 - A sudden pause in your conversation arrives with a sense of worry and curiousity, as you notice
                in the tree tops a head of you a few small subtle smoke plumes. Not far down the road, towards your
                destination of waterdeep, a sense of danger and destruction appears in the sky.</p>
              <hr />
              <h4>Althea and Anthony</h4>
              <p>The Grey's Glory, known to the locals as "Old Glory", aptly named for the Frost Giant Harshnag's
                adventuring company who notoriously saved the city a time or two, a renowned tavern nestled within the
                heart of Waterdeep, exudes warmth and merriment. The sign that hangs above the door is only a picture of
                a giant's head wearing a skull of a dragon like a hat.</p>
              <p>As you step through its weathered wooden door, the aroma of spiced ale and hearth-cooked meals
                wafts through the air, inviting you to indulge in the comforts of this bustling establishment.</p>
              <p>Inside, the tavern is a symphony of sights and sounds. The crackling fire casts dancing shadows on the
                rough-hewn stone walls, while the soft glow of flickering candles bathes the room in a warm, amber
                light.
                The low hum of lively conversation and merry laughter fills the air, intermingling with the gentle
                strumming of a bard's lute, creating an inviting melody that weaves through the tapestry of voices.</p>
              <p>In the center of the tavern, an almost shrine of sorts. A fountain ordained with the statues of the
                Legendary Adventuring Company Force Grey, The namesake of this fine establishment, including the same
                wyrmskull wearing ginat from the sign. The pool below filled with many of
                copper tossed in at the hopes of luck from ol' Harshnag himself.</p>
              <p>Amidst the boisterous crowd, you spot a venerable human woman adorned in black hooded robes, seated at
                a
                corner table near the hearth. Her weathered face, etched with lines of experience, radiates an air of
                quiet contemplation. She sits with a straight posture, her presence both serene and commanding. The
                flickering candlelight catches the glint of her focused eyes, hinting at a hidden strength that lies
                within her aging frame. Clad in simple yet well-worn robes, she emanates an aura of wisdom and
                resilience.</p>
              <p>Her gaze drifts toward the bar, where she sees a large humanoid figure with blue-ish skin, ignoring an
                animated conversation with a group of patron to left of his barstool. Towering above the crowd, his
                impressive stature
                bears the unmistakable traits of his orcish lineage, juxtaposed with an air of refinement and curiosity.
                His deep, cobalt eyes glimmer with a hunger for knowledge, betraying the depths of his intellect and the
                endless pursuit of arcane mastery. Dressed in scholarly robes, he carries an air of grace that defies
                his
                brutish origins.</p>
              <p>Melissa and Anthony... the floor is yours.</p>
              <hr />
              <p>A couple things happen in this surrounding bar that peak your interest. A small fight breaks out over a
                few coins and a cheated card but quickly gets handled. A begging woman with curly dirty brown hair
                [BELDORA] stumbles weakily around the tavern asking for a few coin - "can you spare just a copper or two
                sir, I dont ask for much". And a Tall dark skinned man comes briskly into the front door in urgency. The room grows silent for a minute and then picks back up in conversation.</p>
              <p>The man, wearing dark blue robes and some strong sturdy leather armor with some solid iron pauldrins, a gold badge adorns his lapel. His age shows in his beard and crow's feet but no wear else as he is well built with soft eyes. He approaches the bar with haste</p>
              <p>Roll perception, anthony with advantage</p>
              <p>This is the conversation you hear:<br/>
                <p>Liam: "Markham! Long time old friend!"<br/>Markham: "Liam FallBright. It has been some time. You look well."<br/> They shake. <br/> Liam: "You as well! The Pauldrins! Wow! What brings you all the way from Bryn shander? That's quite a journey!"<br/>M: "Ah. No Liam. Not bryn shander". He flashes him his badge.<br/> L: "SHERIFF Markham Southwell!" The bar gets a little quiet now as eyes shift toward the bar. Liam relies his mistake. "of Triboar!" He says a little more loudly and the bar returns to its normal banter.<br/>Markham smirks. L: "the question still stands, friend. what brings you to the deep?"<br/>M: "Nightstone."<br/>L:"Of course! Semile. How is your sister?"<br/> M: "Thats what I'm trying to find out. Have you not heard the..." he looks around. "Huge Rumors?"<br/> L:"M this is the Glory." He points at the fountain. "If it involves the larger than life, we've heard..." a moment aof realization comes across his face. "...ah. nightstone...what can I do."<br/> M: "I need some hands. I can't do this on my own." L: "Hence your visit the the Glory." He pauses. L:"*Whistles* Alright, Glory!" everyone starts pounding Fists on the table. A clear ritual of this tavern. "What say you? A short journey to nightstone for ol' markham here."<br/> The bar is silent. Liam with a quisitive look.<br/>"Are yall lot deaf or am

              <h4>Nightstone</h4>
              <p>As you approach Nightstone, you find the village nestled within a natural moat-like river
                that flows around its perimeter, acting as a protective barrier. The river's gentle current glistens
                under the sun, encircling the settlement like a liquid moat. A wooden palisade stands tall, outlining
                the boundaries of the village, and through its gaps, one can catch glimpses of a windmill, a tall
                steeple, and several imposing buildings that rise above the humble homes.</p>

              <p>The gate, once an imposing barrier, now creaks ominously in the wind, as if whispering tales of the
                chaos that unfolded. Beyond the gate, the main thoroughfare is eerily quiet, a ghostly stillness that
                permeates the abandoned homes and buildings. Broken shutters flap eerily in the breeze, and a sense of
                unease settles upon anyone who ventures further into the heart of Nightstone.</p>

              <p>The town square, once a bustling center of activity, is now hauntingly empty. The remnants of shattered
                windows glimmer with shards of glass, mirroring the shattered hopes of the town's former inhabitants.
                Adjacent to the square stands a bell tower, its spire reaching towards the heavens. The tolling of the
                bell reverberates through the air, its sound piercing the silence that otherwise envelopes the village.
                Its constant ringing adds a disconcerting layer to the atmosphere, as if it is a beckoning call or a
                warning of the danger that still lingers nearby. Nightstone, once a picturesque haven, has transformed into a ghostly remnant of its former self.</p>

              <p>A lowered drawbridge spans the moat, providing access to the village. Two sturdy stone watchtowers
                flank the open gap in the palisade, standing as silent sentinels, remnants of a once vigilant defense.
                South of the village, isolated and elevated, a cone-shaped hill rises with a flat top. Perched atop this
                hill, a partially collapsed stone keep commands a commanding view of the entire settlement. The keep,
                its walls crumbling and timeworn, stands enclosed by a weathered wooden wall.</p>
              <p>The bridge that once connected the keep to the village, a vital lifeline between the two, has suffered
                the ravages of the previous conflict. A large gap from a fallen boulder spans the middle of the bridge, separating the two land masses. Its broken sections hang precariously, a
                testament to the hardships endured. Though damaged, it serves as a poignant reminder of the
                village's recent destruction and the challenges that lie ahead.</p>

            <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Ember is a striking young woman with a vibrant presence. Her most notable
              feature is her
              lustrous blue hair, reminiscent of her famous father, Flint Tweetings. Despite her age, her half-elf
              lineage gives her a timeless beauty that captivates those who meet her. Ember's youthful visage may make
              her look younger than her actual age, but her commanding presence and strength reveal a maturity beyond
              her years.</p>

            <p><strong>Attire:</strong> Ember proudly wears her father's old blue denim vest, a treasured heirloom that
              she has
              meticulously tailored to fit her form. The vest carries the weight of her family's legacy and symbolizes
              her commitment to carrying on her father's spirit. Beneath the vest, she dons practical yet stylish
              clothing befitting a leader. Her attire reflects her confidence and practicality, allowing her to move
              freely while still commanding respect.</p>

              daughter of a
              renowned NPC has shaped her into a natural leader. She carries herself with authority, earning the
              respect
              and loyalty of those around her. Ember is known for her unwavering dedication to protecting Triboar, and
              she takes her responsibilities as Lord Protector seriously. Despite her strong demeanor, she has a
              compassionate heart and strives to bring justice and prosperity to her people.</p>

            <p><strong>Abilities:</strong> Ember possesses physical and mental prowess, blending the grace and agility
              of her elven
              heritage with the resilience and endurance of her human lineage. Her training as a leader and warrior
              has
              honed her combat skills, making her a formidable opponent on the battlefield. Additionally, she
              possesses
              a sharp intellect and strategic mind, enabling her to make wise decisions in times of crisis.</p>

            <p><strong>Background:</strong> As the daughter of the legendary NPC Flint Tweetings, Ember grew up in the
              shadow of her
              father's reputation. From an early age, she was exposed to tales of his heroic deeds, and she aspired to
              follow in his footsteps. As she came of age, Ember embraced her destiny and dedicated herself to
              protecting the town of Triboar. Through rigorous training and her inherent abilities, she earned the
              trust
              of the town's inhabitants and was eventually appointed as their Lord Protector.</p>

            <p><strong>Motivation:</strong> Ember's primary motivation is to honor her father's legacy and protect the
              people of

            <p>Sheriff Markham Southwell of Triboar is a brawny, likeable man of few words. nothing is more important to

            <h2>Droop and Rook</h2>
            <p>As the characters continue their travels through the northern lands, their ears catch a distant rumbling,
              like the heavy footsteps of giants approaching. The ground beneath them trembles, but to their surprise,
              the source of the commotion is not what they expected. Emerging from the horizon is a fantastical
              contraption, a marvel of engineering and eccentricity â€“ the "Walking Boat."</p>
            <p>This extraordinary vessel defies convention, resembling a peculiar fusion of a ship and a mechanical
              marvel. Its hull is bulbous and round, akin to a roly-poly figure, with metal plates of various shades
              forming its outer shell. Gears and pistons protrude from its sides, whirring and clanking in a
              synchronized symphony of motion. Steam billows from chimneys and vents, creating an ethereal mist that
              shrouds the contraption in an air of mystery.</p>
            <p>As the characters draw nearer, they witness the boat's whimsical features. From the bow sprouts a pair of
              oversized paddle-like feet, adorned with mismatched shoes that clomp and shuffle with every step. Each
              foot has a distinct personality, one adorned with vibrant colors and the other bearing a patchwork of
              mismatched patterns. This quirkiness extends to the boat's body, where gears spin haphazardly,
              occasionally releasing a burst of glitter or emitting a playful whistle.</p>
            <p>Perched atop the vessel, the characters spot the source of the rumbling â€“ two goblins named Droop and
              Rook. These mischievous and lighthearted goblins are the orchestrators of this wondrous creation. Droop,
              with his frizzy green hair and oversized goggles, can be seen darting between control panels, adjusting
              levers and buttons with glee. Rook, sporting a top hat adorned with feathers and an assortment of tools
              dangling from his belt, enthusiastically operates a series of cranks, causing the boat's legs to move in a
              comical fashion.</p>
            <p>Amidst the churning gears and rhythmic clanks, the walking boat exudes an aura of whimsy and adventure.
              It's a testament to the goblins' creativity and their penchant for weaving together practicality and fun.
              As the characters encounter Droop and Rook, they can't help but be drawn into their infectious enthusiasm
              and the promise of unconventional escapades that await aboard this fantastical vessel.</p>
