            <h3>Prologue</h3>
            <p>The Sword Coast, a land of vast beauty and diverse cultures, stretches along the western shores of Faerûn in the Forgotten Realms. Its cities and towns teem with life, bustling with adventurers seeking glory, riches, and the thrill of daring quests. Yet, beyond the surface, shadows stir, and the winds carry whispers of impending change.</p>
            <p>Amidst this coastline, the factions of the realm maneuver in the shadows, each with their own agenda. Many factions including, The Lords' Alliance, a coalition of influential cities and leaders, seeks to uphold order and rally the forces of good and justice. The Harpers, a clandestine organization with eyes and ears in every corner, strive to uncover secrets and protect the innocent. The Zhentarim, enigmatic and inscrutable, manipulate events for their own gain but in what they believe is good for the realms. And many others working deep in the shadows or for the good of fae'run.</p>
            <p>In the celestial realm, the gods watch over their domains. Temples and shrines dedicated to these deities stand as beacons of hope, offering solace to those seeking divine intervention. From the stalwart Helm, guardian of the innocent, to Tymora, lady luck herself, the gods' influence shapes the destinies of mortals.</p>
            <p>The Sword Coast, however, is not merely a realm of factions and divine influence. Mighty dragons, majestic and fearsome, soar through the skies, their presence a testament to their power. Ogres, Bugbears and goblins, lurk in murky corners. Dwarves, Elves, and elementals all make their presence known. Some creatures are benevolent, bestowing wisdom or aid upon those they deem worthy. Others, driven by greed and aggression, leave a trail of destruction in their wake. Legends speak of ancient artifacts, imbued with extraordinary power, hidden within treacherous dungeons or guarded by formidable foes.</p>
            <p>In present day on the sword coast, Rumors have begun to circulate, like ripples in a pond, speaking of mysterious rumblings in the depths of the wilds. Hushed voices speak of colossal beings, their presence felt in the tremors of the earth and the distant echoes of thunderous footsteps. But the nature and purpose of these massive figures remain shrouded in uncertainty.</p>
            <p>As these whispers spread, fear tinges the air, and the people of the Sword Coast find themselves on the edge of anticipation. The ground quivers with each passing day, leaving villages and settlements on alert, uncertain of what the future may hold.</p>
            <p>And so, as destiny weaves its tapestry, your paths converge. United by a common purpose, you find yourselves drawn into a journey that will lead you across the breadth of the Sword Coast. From the bustling streets of Waterdeep, the City of Splendors, to the ancient ruins of Neverwinter, and even to the untamed wilderness of the Savage Frontier, your adventure will take you to both familiar and unknown territories.</p>
            <p>With each step you take, you will encounter allies and adversaries, face trials and tribulations, and uncover the secrets that lie within the realm. The Sword Coast awaits, a canvas for your heroic exploits and a crucible for your character's growth. The fate of the realms rests in your hands, and the choices you make will shape the course of this world.</p>
            <p>Prepare yourselves, valiant adventurers, for an extraordinary odyssey through the Sword Coast. The stage is set, the curtain rises, and your epic quest begins.</p>

            <h3>Previously on DND...</h3>
            <p>In our latest session, our adventurers found themselves on the High Road, a path leading from Nightstone to Waterdeep. Yelton, a clever and curious gnome wizard, crossed paths with Celeste, a formidable and enigmatic aasimar barbarian. Intrigued by a plume of smoke in the distance, they decided to investigate its source.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, in the renowned Grey's Glory Tavern in Waterdeep, named after the famous Harshnag's Adventuring Company Force Grey, Durk, a half-orc wizard, and Sister Althea, a wise and compassionate old human monk, overheard a conversation between Liam Fallbright, the Dragonborn bartender, and Markham Southwell, the Sheriff of Triboar. Markham sought assistance in exploring the troubled village of Nightstone, which housed his sister Semile. A group was to convene at the tavern's central fountain the next morning to embark on this perilous journey.</p>
            <p>As night fell, Durk and Althea departed the tavern, with Althea extending an act of kindness by providing a nourishing meal to a homeless woman. The following morning, they met Markham at the fountain, where negotiations ensued. Durk requested payment, Althea sought an escort for their travels, and Markham agreed to a fee of 8 gold after the completion of the task.</p>
            <p>The group converged at the entrance to Nightstone, joined by Celeste and Yelton, and under Markham's lead, ventured into the abandoned village. The devastating aftermath of giant attacks became evident, with boulders strewn about, wreaking havoc upon the once-peaceful settlement. A quiet eeiry vibe filled the air of this destroyed village only broken by the sound of a incessant ringing bell coming from the assumed village temple. However, their attention was quickly drawn to the sight of two worgs feasting on a lifeless dog.</p>
            <p>With newfound determination, our heroes engaged in their first combat encounter, valiantly fighting the worgs and attracting the attention of goblins, who emerged from the ransacked houses. The skirmish was intense, with weapons clashing and spells crackling through the air.</p> 
            <p>The worgs bit and clawed their way into those that struck them. Markham was mostly able to fend off their attacks while Celeste lost the upperhand (Quite litterally) after falling into a recent excavation site in the middle of the town square. Fighting at a lower vantage point with success, by cutting off the toes of her foe, put her in harm's way as a worg threw her like a ragdoll across the square, knocking her unconcious.</p>
            <p>Yelton, Durk, and Althea tried their hand at besting the wave of goblin attackers. Yelton held back a goblin with a ray of frost, slowing its approach into the fray. Durk and Althea charged two others and quickly eviscerated the two foes as if they were worthless meat sacks.</p>
            <p>In the end, two worgs and two goblins fell, while one goblin was captured for further interrogation.</p>
            <p>Undeterred by the battle's toll, minus a few scratches and a little health potion from Markham to alleviate some of Celeste's ailments, the group continued to explore Nightstone, seeking any sign of evil and hoping to locate Semile, Markham's sister. Sadly, their search led them to Semile's house, where they discovered her lifeless body crushed under a massive boulder. Althea, with the inert goblin in toe, remained by Markham's side as he took a minute to himself, while the rest of the group proceeded to investigate the local inn.</p>
            <p>Peeking through a dust covered window in the back of the inn, Durk found the kitchen in disarray with another vile creature wreaking havoc in the room. He sent a vocal projection in the room that confused the goblin, he didnt know who or what it was but only that it frightened him and forced him to flee into the awaiting ambush of the adventurers. Trying to make a daring escape, Durk tossed the Gnome Yelton like a sack of flour in an effort to stop his pursuit. Although, sustaining some cuts and bruises on the tumble, Yelton annihilated the poor fleeing monstrosity.</p>
            <p>Inside the inn, Celeste's keen senses guided her to a dining room, where she discovered a large rock jutting through the ceiling and an ominous crossbow bolt sticking from a goblin's chest pinned to a broken table. As she pondered its origin with curiosity piqued, Celeste called out, and a woman above revealed herself.</p>
            <p>Returning to the Late Southwell's Residence, Durk presented Althea with belongings recovered from the kitchen goblin's ransacking finding the unconcious goblin returning to the waking world. While Althea attempted to calm the captive goblin, Durk's presence compelled the creature to speak. The goblin, sent by his boss Hark, admitted to pillaging the village on the orders of their leader. He revealed that the villagers sought refuge in nearby caves after a supposed giant attack, giving the goblins free reign to pillage the abandoned settlement.</p>
            <p>Back upstairs, Celeste and Yelton discovered a barricaded door obstructed by debris. Working together, they cleared the path and encountered Kella Darkhope, accompanied by her loyal flying snake pet, trapped in the bedroom. Yelton's revelation of his own familiar, a whimsical unirabbit struck a chord of familiarity between them.</p>
            <p>With Kella's rescue and the goblin's revelations, our adventurers reached a momentary pause in their quest. The mysteries of Nightstone deepened, and their determination to uncover the truth grew.</p>

              <h3>Previously on DND...</h3>
              <p>In the realm of Dungeons & Dragons, two distinct paths converge on the High Road, just south of Nightstone and Waterdeep. There, fate brings together Yelton, a brilliant Gnome Wizard with an affinity for arcane mysteries, and Celeste, an imposing Aasimar Barbarian, resembling a Viking warrior with her silver dreaded hair and honey-gold eyes. As they exchange pleasantries, an ominous sight catches their attention—a plume of smoke rising from the direction of Nightstone.</p>
              <p>Curiosity piqued, Yelton and Celeste venture forth to investigate the source of the smoke. Meanwhile, in the bustling city of Waterdeep, a chance encounter occurs between Durk, a Half-Orc disgruntlted Wizard?, and Sister Althea, an elderly kind yet formidable Human Monk. Their paths intertwine at the Grey's Glory, a renowned tavern named after Harshnag's adventuring company "Force Grey."</p>
              <p>Inside the tavern, the Dragonborn Bartender, Liam Fallbright, shares news of giant rumors surrounding Nightstone. Markham Southwell, Sheriff of Triboar and a close friend of Liam's, seeks assistance to explore the town where his sister Semile resided. Her mysterious disappearance during the boulder bombardment troubles him deeply.</p>
              <p>As the adventurers embark on their quest, Althea and Durk leave Waterdeep through the night. In an act of kindness, Althea offers a warm meal to a homeless woman, a glimmer of humanity amidst the growing shadows of their journey. The next morning, they meet Markham at the fountain, and the quest begins.</p>
              <p>Their arrival at Nightstone unveils a town marred by destruction—boulders scattered like grotesque artifacts of the giants' malevolence. Kella Darkhope, a visitor trapped in her room, shares her harrowing experience of awakening to the desolation. Yelton and Celeste promise to rescue her once they rid the town of goblin invaders.</p>
              <p>At the Southwell Residence, Markham gathers his sister's belongings before departing, leaving Althea and Durk to continue clearing the town. The sound of a bell lures them to the temple dedicated to Lathander and Mielikki. Inside, goblins desecrate the sanctity, but the party swiftly restores order, finding a holy symbol of Mielikki in the shape of a unicorn's head.</p>
              <p>Venturing deeper into the town, the adventurers encounter resistance in the barn, but Durk's tenacity leads them to victory. As they continue, they drive out goblins from the windmill and gather much-needed supplies from a ransacked general store. With newfound strength, they level up in their abilities, a testament to their resilience and unity.</p>
              <p>The party presses on, crossing the broken bridge to reach the town keep, guarded by four seemingly timid sentries. The revelation of Lady Nandar's fate, crushed under debris, intensifies their resolve to find the townspeople who might have sought refuge in the dripping caves nearby.</p>
              <p>Frustrated by the guards' passivity, the adventurers quickly return to the town square, only to encounter Seven Hooded figures on horseback dragging with them - a Cart built like a cage with a blue Hooded figure with dark orange robes and a woman with dark purple hair both bound. The supposedly leader of the group demanding the presence of Kella Darkhope. The shadows of treachery and mystery loom large over Nightstone, drawing the party further into the heart of an enthralling tale, where secrets and challenges intertwine, and the fate of the realm hangs in the balance.</p>

            <p>As the adventurers faced the ominous Seven Hooded figures, their true identities were revealed—they were the Zhentarim, seeking to seize control of the town for their own nefarious purposes. Before the tension could escalate further, chaos ensued as a battle-hardened horde of orcs descended upon the scene, vying to claim the town for themselves. The clash between the Zhentarim and the orc invaders erupted, forcing the party into a precarious situation.</p>
            <p>Among the captives of the Zhentarim were Aspari and Tipp, the other members of the group. The heroes seized a moment of distraction during the skirmish to free themselves from their binds and joined the fray. As the battle raged on, the relentless onslaught of the orcs pushed Althea and Aspari to the brink, but their determination prevailed, and they stood once more to face the threats that surrounded them.</p>
            <p>Yelton, the resourceful Gnome Wizard, devised a clever illusion, conjuring the image of a fearsome dragon descending upon the battlefield. The ruse terrified both the bandits and the entire orc party, giving the party a momentary advantage. However, the orc chief and his loyal second-in-command remained steadfast, determined to fight until the bitter end.</p>
            <p>Amidst the chaos, the party engaged in a heated discussion with the Zhentarim. Aspari revealed that the item they had stolen from the Lords' Alliance was an Amulet of the Planes, a powerful and coveted artifact. This revelation caught the attention of Durk, who recognized its description from his extensive studies in arcane artifacts.</p>
            <p>With the Zhentarim refusing to leave the town peacefully, a standoff ensued. The group aimed to recover the stolen amulet and return it to its rightful owners, but the bandits were unwilling to relinquish their newfound prize without a fight. Aspari's familiarity with the artifact, combined with Durk's knowledge, sparked the adventurers' determination to reclaim the amulet and put an end to the chaos that had befallen the once-peaceful town of Nightstone.</p>
            <p>The stage is set for a thrilling confrontation, where secrets, power struggles, and dangerous ambitions converge. The heroes find themselves entwined in a web of intrigue that will test their wits, alliances, and strength as they strive to regain control of Nightstone and unravel the enigma of the Amulet of the Planes. As the journey continues, the adventurers must navigate treacherous waters, make difficult choices, and confront their destinies in this gripping tale of adventure and mystery.</p>

            <p>As our intrepid adventurers continued their journey, they found themselves in the enigmatic tower of Zephyros, the storm giant. In the library of this towering edifice, they uncovered ancient knowledge regarding giants and the Thousand Year War. Among the dusty tomes, they also stumbled upon valuable spell scrolls that promised to enhance their magical prowess.</p>
            <p>The tranquility of their stay was abruptly shattered when a horde of flying crabs, ridden by merciless bandits, besieged the tower. A fierce battle ensued, and our heroes valiantly defended the sanctity of Zephyros' abode, emerging victorious but weary from the confrontation.</p>
            <p>However, the worst was yet to come. As if foretold by fate, a malevolent blue dragon swooped down upon the tower, ripping out the vital traveling orb that sustained the castle's flight. The consequences were dire, as the once-soaring tower plummeted earthward, its descent a prelude to certain doom.</p>
            <p>Resourceful as ever, the party discovered hidden mechanisms within the tower's walls meant to stabilize its fall. They worked together, pulling levers and navigating through debris-strewn chambers to slow the castle's descent, averting a potentially catastrophic crash.</p>
            <p>As the tower neared the ground, each adventurer braced for impact in their own way. Some chose to leap from the plummeting castle, employing spells like Feather Fall to descend safely. Celeste, with newfound celestial wings, soared through the skies to save her comrades, exhibiting a breathtaking display of bravery.</p>
            <p>Miraculously, the castle crashed without fatalities, though Zephyros lay unconscious from the ordeal. The survivors quickly set up camp amidst the wreckage, as the unknown land where they had landed was cloaked in darkness.</p>
            <p>In the chaos of it all, The adventurers almost forgot about the lone crab rider who seemed to survive the attack. They awoke him from his unconcious state and began to threaten him only to find he too was unaware of what was going on. He, only mere days before, was recruited to the Kraken' Society. A band of Mercs, Theives and Bandits looking to do the bidding of the great Slarkrethel. The man was promised wealth, hospitality and direction in life. found slumming the cobbled streets of Yartar. As an initiation, he was told he was to ride with other initiates and society members to the floating castle to stop it's journey by any means. Out of the kindness of their hearts, Aspari sent the man on his way with promis that he would not return to this society.</p>
            <p>The stillness of the night was disturbed by the sudden arrival of a mysterious figure in an eerie carriage. This enigmatic character, known as Verek, introduced himself as a traveling merchant peddling "Peculiar Wares and Eccentric Oddities." However, the party couldn't help but sense an underlying malevolence in his demeanor.</p>
            <p>The fates of our adventurers hang in the balance as they confront the aftermath of their descent and the enigmatic presence of Verek, setting the stage for the next chapter in their perilous journey.</p>

            <p>Sheriff Markham Southwell of Triboar is a brawny, likeable man of few words. nothing is more important to

          <div id="drook" class="accordion-info">
            <h2>Droop and Rook</h2>
            <p>As the characters continue their travels through the northern lands, their ears catch a distant rumbling,
              like the heavy footsteps of giants approaching. The ground beneath them trembles, but to their surprise,
              the source of the commotion is not what they expected. Emerging from the horizon is a fantastical
              contraption, a marvel of engineering and eccentricity – the "Walking Boat."</p>
            <p>This extraordinary vessel defies convention, resembling a peculiar fusion of a ship and a mechanical
              marvel. Its hull is bulbous and round, akin to a roly-poly figure, with metal plates of various shades
              forming its outer shell. Gears and pistons protrude from its sides, whirring and clanking in a
              synchronized symphony of motion. Steam billows from chimneys and vents, creating an ethereal mist that
              shrouds the contraption in an air of mystery.</p>
            <p>As the characters draw nearer, they witness the boat's whimsical features. From the bow sprouts a pair of
              oversized paddle-like feet, adorned with mismatched shoes that clomp and shuffle with every step. Each
              foot has a distinct personality, one adorned with vibrant colors and the other bearing a patchwork of
              mismatched patterns. This quirkiness extends to the boat's body, where gears spin haphazardly,
              occasionally releasing a burst of glitter or emitting a playful whistle.</p>
            <p>Perched atop the vessel, the characters spot the source of the rumbling – two goblins named Droop and
              Rook. These mischievous and lighthearted goblins are the orchestrators of this wondrous creation. Droop,
              with his frizzy green hair and oversized goggles, can be seen darting between control panels, adjusting
              levers and buttons with glee. Rook, sporting a top hat adorned with feathers and an assortment of tools
              dangling from his belt, enthusiastically operates a series of cranks, causing the boat's legs to move in a
              comical fashion.</p>
            <p>Amidst the churning gears and rhythmic clanks, the walking boat exudes an aura of whimsy and adventure.
              It's a testament to the goblins' creativity and their penchant for weaving together practicality and fun.
              As the characters encounter Droop and Rook, they can't help but be drawn into their infectious enthusiasm
              and the promise of unconventional escapades that await aboard this fantastical vessel.</p>

        <div id="zephTower" class="accordion-info">
        <h4>Second Floor</h4>
          <p>You find yourselves in a massive, opulent but purposeful chamber. Its quirkey as it is messy and mechanical as much as it is lavish. Adorned on each of its four full walls are grand murals and intricate carvings. These artistic masterpieces depict a couple things: The wall closest to the orb - a full map of what you recognize to be Fae-run yet written in giant tongue ( 6 Runes marking the location of giant settlements). The 3 other murals showcase Giant Prowess. One portrays a formidable cloud giant, dressed in ornate armor, standing atop a floating cumulus cloud. The giant's eyes gleam with lightning, and a swirling storm rages behind them, casting dramatic lightning bolts across the sky.. Another, showcases a breathtaking aerial view of a floating archipelago of islands, each with lush green landscapes and cascading waterfalls. Bridges and pathways connect the islands, creating a harmonious and serene scene. The clouds surrounding the islands, a familiar image of castles floating atop each. And Finally.. A self portrait of Zephyros himself..Except like Really buff and much ....much younger. Flanking each of the murals on its walls are two extremely large sconces but with a magical orb of light rather than a flame illuminating the room, however still flickering as if to give of the warms of an actual flame. The two additional walls opposite each other stands too very ornate balconies with large entrically decorated wooden lattice screen doors preventing most of the wind from the brisk air shooting through the chamber accompanied by some very interestingly decorated curtains as if the deisgn was crudely hand painted to look sophisticated yet not quite achieved.</p>
          <p>In the center of this vast chamber sits a crystalline orb. Zephyros walks by it placing his palm upon the orb and swirling his finger as if scrolling before tapping on what seems to be a random spot on the orb. You feel a soft pull and realize the castle has stopped from hovering and is now lifted high in the sky and begins its travel north. Zephyros explains it is this magnificent orb that maintains the delicate unity of the castle's elemental forces, allowing it to soar among the clouds to any destination of its choosing while interacting with the counterweights within the walls, as he carresses his own mural - "keeping it upright".</p>
          <p>Inside this massive chamber you also notice a couple other interesting features. A colossal lab bench with beakers and makeshift microscopes looking very carefully at what now seem extremely underwhelming small folk items like a lantern and a satchel. A large chest opened brimming with a ranodm collection of items like normal sized decorative curtains that resemble a similar pattern yet, </p>
          <p>There's a massive book case with several large books overwhelming in size but also a stack of normal sized books that barely measure in stature. A couple oversized cushions and a rug and what looks to be a glass tower, in actuality a large smoking pipe. in the center of this lounging area.</p>
          <p>On the cieling a massive chandelier hangs delicately and another hole into the room above. Zepheros asks politely on first glance of this hole - "I do ask that you politely allow me some privacy in my chambers while you visit my home" as he points to the hole and then sways his arms to the cushions "but you are more than welcome to take repose amongst the library"</p>
