                  <dd>Above table talk at a minimum please. Please try and keep all discussions in character if related to
                    story and actions (not if its a rule question). 'Critical Role play' as much as possible. This WILL
                    affect gameplay.
                    <br /><br />For example, if your talking about whether you're going to attack someone or kill them
                    after - you better whisper and roll stealth cause they may have heard you...<br /><br /><i>This is in

                  <dd>Long Rests are going to be more difficult. You need to have ample conditions to take a long rest.
                    Otherwise, a short rest will be necessary. This means walls and lodging or guard shifts if in the
                    wilderness with somewhere where you can get 8 hours of sleep. I will be having a difficulty level for where you choose to set up camp that you wont be aware of. The night brings interesting creatures. Also, if you choose to have someone stand guard, they dont get the benefits of a rest. If you choose to people to stand guard, they get the beneifts of a short rest only.<br /><br /><i>This is in an effort to
                      bring awareness to surroundings and danger, make your headstrong pushes in to battle more critical,

                <h3>Notes - Setting Details</h3>
                <p>We are in the same setting as our previous campaign but roughly 100 years in the future. Your former
                  characters were not much heard of as they dissapeared upon exploring wave echo cave and never returned
                  with the exception of stories past down from a few adventurers long before this time. About 400 years
                  ago, A Rudolph Van Richten and his protege, Ezmerelda, wrote a "guide to Ravenloft" which mentioned
                  individuals matching your missing adventurers but have not been heard from again.</p>
                <p>In this beginning, I'm going to give a large intro to set the scene and get us started. It will give us a lot of details of fae'run and the lore within.</p>
                <p>I will then illustrate a setting for your characters. When I give you the floor, please describe your character followed by a little role play of what your character does or says before I continue on.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="prologue">
                <h3>Prologue</h3>
                <p>The Sword Coast, a land of vast beauty and diverse cultures, stretches along the western shores of Faerûn
                  in the Forgotten Realms. Its cities and towns teem with life, bustling with adventurers seeking glory,
                  riches, and the thrill of daring quests. Yet, beyond the surface, shadows stir, and the winds carry
                  whispers of impending change.</p>
                <p>Rumors have begun to circulate, like ripples in a pond, speaking of mysterious rumblings in the depths of
                  the wilds. Hushed voices speak of colossal beings, their presence felt in the tremors of the earth and the
                  distant echoes of thunderous footsteps. But the nature and purpose of these massive figures remain
                  shrouded in uncertainty.</p>
                <p>As these whispers spread, fear tinges the air, and the people of the Sword Coast find themselves on the
                  edge of anticipation. The ground quivers with each passing day, leaving villages and settlements on alert,
                  uncertain of what the future may hold.</p>
                <p>Amidst this growing unease, the factions of the realm maneuver in the shadows, each with their own
                  agenda. The Lords' Alliance, a coalition of influential cities and leaders, seeks to uphold order and
                  rally the forces of good and justice. The Harpers, a clandestine organization with eyes and ears in every
                  corner, strive to uncover secrets and protect the innocent. The Zhentarim, enigmatic and inscrutable,
                  manipulate events for their own gain. And the Emerald Enclave, staunch defenders of nature, work to
                  maintain the delicate balance between civilization and the wild.</p>
                <p>In the celestial realm, the gods watch over their domains with increasing concern. Temples and shrines
                  dedicated to these deities stand as beacons of hope, offering solace to those seeking divine intervention.
                  From the stalwart Helm, guardian of the innocent, to Tymora, lady luck herself, the gods'
                  influence shapes the destinies of mortals.</p>
                <p>The Sword Coast, however, is not merely a realm of factions and divine influence. Mighty dragons,
                  majestic and fearsome, soar through the skies, their presence a testament to their power. Some dragons are
                  benevolent, bestowing wisdom and aid upon those they deem worthy. Others, driven by greed and aggression,
                  leave a trail of destruction in their wake. Legends speak of ancient artifacts forged in dragonfire,
                  imbued with extraordinary power, hidden within treacherous dungeons or guarded by formidable creatures.</p>
                <p>And so, as destiny weaves its tapestry, your paths converge. United by a common purpose, you find
                  yourselves drawn into a journey that will lead you across the breadth of the Sword Coast. From the
                  bustling streets of Waterdeep, the City of Splendors, to the ancient ruins of Neverwinter, and even to the
                  untamed wilderness of the Savage Frontier, your adventure will take you to both familiar and unknown
                  territories.</p>
                <p>With each step you take, you will encounter allies and adversaries, face trials and tribulations, and
                  uncover the secrets that lie within the realm. The Sword Coast awaits, a canvas for your heroic exploits
                  and a crucible for your character's growth. The fate of the realms rests in your hands, and the choices
                  you make will shape the course of this world.</p>
                <p>Prepare yourselves, valiant adventurers, for an extraordinary odyssey through the Sword Coast. The stage
                  is set, the curtain rises, and your epic quest begins.</p>
                <hr />
                <h3>Character Intros</h3>
                <h4>Yeldon and Celeste</h4>
                <p>As the sun dawns, casting a warm golden glow over the landscape, the High Road stretches south of Waterdeep, meandering through the northern reaches of the region. The road cuts a path through dense forests, where towering trees create a canopy overhead, dappling the path with patches of sunlight. A gentle breeze rustles through the leaves, carrying with it the earthy fragrance of moss and wildflowers.</p>
                <p>In the growing light, a camp is set up by the roadside, nestled amidst the towering trees. A crackling campfire sends flickering flames into the decreasing darkness, casting dancing shadows upon the gnarled tree trunks. The surrounding forest comes alive with the symphony of chirping birds and the occasional rustle of unseen creatures moving through the underbrush.</p>
                <p>A short stout man walks along the High Road, their eyes widen in surprise at the sight of the campsite and its lone inhabitant gathering their belongings. Standing tall and well-built, the figure exudes strength and resilience. Silver dreaded hair cascades down her back, contrasting with shaved sides, giving her a striking Viking-like appearance. Her honey-gold eyes hold a sense of determination and an unyielding spirit.</p>
                <p>Curiosity piqued, the man stops in their tracks, studying the camp from a distance. The small glasses perched upon their nose amplify their inquisitive gaze. Their elegant red hat adds a touch of whimsy to their gnomish appearance, as if the wild nature of the surroundings has inspired their own sense of adventure.</p>
                <p>The High Road becomes the crossroads where these two individuals' paths intersect, the gnome's journey momentarily halted by the presence of the solitary barbarian. It holds the promise of adventure, companionship, and the chance for these disparate souls to find their respective places in a world filled with mystery and possibilities.</p>
                <p>Tristan and Alec, the floor is yours...</p>
                <hr/>
                <p>Will you both roll a perception check for me?</p>
                <p>+ 10 - A sudden pause in your conversation arrives with a sense of worry and curiousity, as you notice in the tree tops a head of you a few small subtle smoke plumes. Not far down the road, towards your destination of waterdeep, a sense of danger and destruction appears in the sky.</p>
                <hr/>
                <h4>Althea and Anthony</h4>
                <p>The Grey's Glory, known to the locals as "Old Glory", aptly named for the Frost Giant Harshnag's adventuring company who notoriously save the city a time or two, a renowned tavern nestled within the heart of Waterdeep, exudes warmth and
                  merriment.</p>
                <p>As you step through its weathered wooden door, the aroma of spiced ale and hearth-cooked meals
                  wafts through the air, inviting you to indulge in the comforts of this bustling establishment.</p>
                <p>Inside, the tavern is a symphony of sights and sounds. The crackling fire casts dancing shadows on the
                  rough-hewn stone walls, while the soft glow of flickering candles bathes the room in a warm, amber light.
                  The low hum of lively conversation and merry laughter fills the air, intermingling with the gentle
                  strumming of a bard's lute, creating an inviting melody that weaves through the tapestry of voices.</p>
                <p>In the center of the tavern, an almost shrine of sorts. A fountain ordained with the statues of the Legendary Adventuring Company Force Grey, The namesake of this fine establishment, filled with many of copper tossed in at the hopes of luck from ol' Harshnag himself.</p>
                <p>Amidst the boisterous crowd, you spot a venerable human woman adorned in black hooded robes, seated at a
                  corner table near the hearth. Her weathered face, etched with lines of experience, radiates an air of
                  quiet contemplation. She sits with a straight posture, her presence both serene and commanding. The
                  flickering candlelight catches the glint of her focused eyes, hinting at a hidden strength that lies
                  within her aging frame. Clad in simple yet well-worn robes, she emanates an aura of wisdom and resilience.</p>
                <p>Her gaze drifts toward the bar, where she sees a large humanoid figure with blue-ish skin, ignoring an animated conversation with a group of patron to left of his barstool. Towering above the crowd, his impressive stature
                  bears the unmistakable traits of his orcish lineage, juxtaposed with an air of refinement and curiosity.
                  His deep, emerald eyes glimmer with a hunger for knowledge, betraying the depths of his intellect and the
                  endless pursuit of arcane mastery. Dressed in scholarly robes, he carries an air of grace that defies his
                  brutish origins.</p>
                <p>Melissa and Anthony... the floor is yours.</p>
                <hr/>
                <p>A couple things happen in this surrounding bar that peak your interest. A small fight breaks out over a few coins and a cheated card but quickly gets handled. A begging woman with curly dirty brown hair [BELDORA] stumbles weakily around the tavern asking for a few coin - "can you spare just a copper or two sir, I dont ask for much". And a Tall dark skinned man comes briskly into the front door in urgency.</p>
